Alice and Bob are batch mates and Alice got placed in a well-reputed product-based company and his friend Bob is demanding a pizza party from him. 
Alice is ready for giving party and he ordered N pizzas from the nearest restaurant. Now pizzas can have at most K different flavors (It is not necessary that there should be one pizza of each flavor), 
numbered from 1 to K such that â…ˆ^th pizza can have Ai flavor (1 <= Ai <=k).
Bob is on dieting, and he can only eat pizza of at most k-1 flavors but he can eat as many pizzas of ith flavor and he wanted to choose maximum possible pizzas which are in contiguous sequence 
to one another such that all pizzas in sequence has atmost k-1 flavors.

For example
 6  2          -> here 6 is the number pizzas of and 2 is number of distinct flavors

1 1 1 2 2 1   -> ith pizza has flavor ai

Maximum length of subarray such that subarray has at most k-1 distinct flavors is 3 and that subarray is 1 1 1

Example 1:
Input

6 2            -> Size of input Array and K distinct flavors

1 1 1 2 2 1  -> input array (N Different pizza flavors )

Output
3

Explanation

Maximum length subarray with at most k-1 distinct flavors is 3 and sub array is 1 1 1

Example 2:
Input:

5 3 -> Size of inputs Arrays and K distinct flavors

1 1 2 2 1 -> input array (N Different Pizza Flavors)

Output
5

Explanation
Since N pizza in total has only 2 flavors so bob can eat all pizza so maximum length of subarray with at most k-1 distinct flavors is 5

Constraints

1<N<100000>Size of Array
2<K<100000> Number of different flavors
1<A[i]<100000> Value of ith flavor 0 base indexing

The Input format for testing
The candidate has to write the code to accept 2 inputs.
First Input: It will contain two integer N and K
Second Input: It will contain a N integer separated by space.

Output format for testing
The output will contain a single line containing an integer denoting maximum possible length of subarray.
Additional messages in output will cause the failure of test cases.

Instructions:

System doesn't allow any kind of hard coded input value/values. Written program code by the candidate will be verified against the inputs which are supplied from the system


Case 1
Input (stdin)
6 2
1 1 1 2 2 1

Output (stdout)
3

Case 2
Input (stdin)
5 4
4 4 4 3 4

Output (stdout)
5

CODE(Java):
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        sc.close();
        int r = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int max = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        while (r < n) {
            hm.put(arr[r], hm.getOrDefault(arr[r], 0) + 1);
            // while (hm.size() > k - 1) {
            // hm.put(arr[l], hm.get(arr[l]) - 1);
            // if (hm.get(arr[l]) == 0) {
            // hm.remove(arr[l]);
            // }
            // l++;
            // }
            if (hm.size() <= k - 1) {
                max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
            } else {
                break;
            }
            r++;
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }

}
